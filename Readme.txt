Pup's Buffwatch
---------------
Based on the WoW addon by Tyrrael

Original version here : http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=678

Since the original author has not made any changes to BuffWatch since around
WoW version 1.4, I decided to add the new UnitID's that came with 1.5 to 
make BuffWatch useable with pets and in raid groups. Since it looked increasingly
unlikely that the original author was going to continue development of 
BuffWatch I carried on making various changes as I saw fit, and from comments 
made on the Curse Gaming site.
